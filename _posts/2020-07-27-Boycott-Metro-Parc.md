Climate Justice Montreal is calling for a boycott of the Metro grocery store on Avenue du Parc and Prince-Arthur. Metro board member Maryse Bertrand has called for McGill University to continue its investments in the fossil fuel industry. 

This isn't just about the dozens of millions of dollars that [McGill invests in these companies](https://mcgillinvests.in){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, but also a matter of principle. These investments threaten everyone's future, including that of McGill students and their families.

Because that metro grocery store is particularly McGill-dependent, we call upon locals and McGill students and staff to boycott the store, and let store management know by calling (514) 843-3530.
