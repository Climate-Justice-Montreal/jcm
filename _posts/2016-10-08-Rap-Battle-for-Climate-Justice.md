On September 28th 2016, Climate Justice sponsored another Rap Battle for Climate Justice at Concordia University. With your help, we raised over $800 for ASAP ([Aamjiwnaang and Sarnia Against Pipelines](https://www.facebook.com/AamjiwnaangSarniaAgainstPipelines/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}).
