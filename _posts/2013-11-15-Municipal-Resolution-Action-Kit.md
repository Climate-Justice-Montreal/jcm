In an effort to empower ourselves and our communities in taking a position on energy issues, building together our analysis, our alternatives to carbon dependency, and our capacity for joint action, Climate Justice Montreal is asking the City of Montreal to ban the importation of Tar Sands oil and oppose Enbridgeâ€™s Line 9 pipeline reversal.

As the reality of catastrophic climate change is settling into global consciousness, as tragedies from Kalamazoo to Lac Megantic prove fossil fuels cannot be transported safely, as Indigenous struggles for sovereignty prove to be struggles for all of humanity, we believe collective action to stop the destruction  caused by reckless corporate resource extraction is essential.

By starting in our communities and working with our neighbors, in education and mobilisation, we hope to create upward pressure on city council while growing our allies from the bottom up.

We believe that through cooperative resistance (through the process as much as the actions themselves), we can foster the creation of a society which is more just, less oppressive, and more resilient.

Join us in raising awareness of and solutions to these issues, while asking City Council to say no to Tar Sands expansion.
